Extra credit assignment to re-implement some of the methods from the String class.

CustomString class contains the custom implementations of various String methods. 
Use similarly to Strings, only an explicit new CustomString() call is required to create the objects.

CustomStringTest contains the units tests for the CustomString methods

CustomStringDemo contains a simple driver class that runs through some simple uses for the methods.
Demo also intentionally runs through some of the exceptions that the custom methods can throw
